SQL Alchemy Challenge
In this homework, we worked with SQLalchemy and python, in which several analysis were performed. 
You can find the creation of an API in the app.py file, and three jupyter notebooks with distinct information (climate_starter, temp_analysis_bonus_1_starter,
temp_analysis_bonus_2_starter). Feel free to navigate through this github.
